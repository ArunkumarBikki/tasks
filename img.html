        <p>Virat Kohli was retained by the Royal Challengers Bengaluru (RCB) for the 2025 season for a salary of ₹21 crore, making him the team's top retention. Kohli's retention was expected, given his long history with the team, which dates back to the IPL's inception in 2008:</p>

            <summary>Mohammed Siraj</summary>
            <p>Siraj has been an integral part of RCB’s pace battery since linking up with the franchise at the 2018 IPL Auction for a sum of INR 2.2 Crore, and since then has picked up 83 wickets from 87 matches for the team.</p>
            <p>Now an India international across formats, Siraj’s non-retention did come as a surprise to quite a few fans, but in an episode of RCB Bold Diaries, head coach Andy Flower and Director of Cricket Mo Bobat added weight to the topic and insights into why the right-arm seamer was not retained.</p>
            <p>Flower said, “I'm sure one of the surprises around our retentions will be the fact that we haven't retained Mohamed Siraj. Mohamed Siraj is a successful international cricketer of some standing and has also been with RCB for the last eight years. We want to look for some particular skills in the fast bowling department. We've already identified and retained one of those particular skills that we want, which is the left arm angle and T20 skills that Yash Dayal brings us.”</p>

            <p>Royal Challengers Bengaluru (RCB) and Australia all-rounder Glenn Maxwell opened up on not being retained by his team ahead of the 2025 mega auction. Notably, RCB retained three players for the upcoming season namely Virat Kohli (INR 21 Cr), Rajat Patidar (INR 11 Cr) and Yash Dayal (INR 5 Crore) using INR 37 Crore.</p>
            <p>The Bengaluru-based franchise has three Right to Match (RTM) cards available with them along with the remaining auction purse amount of INR 83 Crore. Among the big names not retained by the franchise was Glenn Maxwell , who’s been a part of the team since 2021. Recently, the all rounder opened up on how the franchise conveyed the message to him and revealed that he was impressed by their handling of the situation.</p>
            <p>“I got a phone call from Mo Bobat and Andy Flower. I sat there on a zoom call, and they sort of explained to me the decision not to be retained. And, it was actually a really beautiful exit meeting, if that if that could be possible. We ended up talking about the game for about half an hour and talking about their strategy and what they were looking to get to do, going forward. So, I was really happy with that,” said Maxwell on ESPNCricinfo’s Around the wicket show.</p>

            <p>"As my chapter close with RCB I want to take a moment to reflect on what an incredible journey this has been. When I joined three years ago, I had no idea how this journey would unfold. But I fell in love with the city of Bengaluru and the amazing people of RCB. This place and its people have become a part of who I am, and I'll carry these memories and the connections I've buit with me forever. Thank you for making these three years so special," Du Plessis wrote on Instagram.</p>
            <p>"Playing at the Chinnaswamy Stadium has been one of the most electric experiences of my career. The energy, the passion, and the support from the fans make it truly one of a kind. Every time I stepped onto that field, the atmosphere was nothing short of magical."</p>
